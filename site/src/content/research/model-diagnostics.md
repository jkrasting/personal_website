Model diagnostics give us critical insight into why climate models behave as they do.  Getting the "right answer for the right reason" is essential to improving the models and building trust in their projections. Traditional benchmark evaluation metrics often mask compensating errors that must be addressed in climate models. Process-oriented diagnostics (PODs) target specific mechanisms (e.g., convection responses or ocean mixing) to reveal strengths and weaknesses in model process representation.  This allows the model developer to focus on exactly here models need improvement and how the simulations best apply to real-world physics.

I co-founded and co-lead NOAA's Model Diagnostics Task Force, a community initiative that has developed over 50 diagnostic tools to evaluate climate models based on fundamental processes. This framework is now used by both NOAA-GFDL and NCAR and contributes to a growing community of practitioners working on systematic model evaluation.  The task force plays an important role in connecting the academic community with the national laboratories conducting model development, fostering collaborations, and providing modeling centers with key insights into stakeholder needs to guide further model development.
