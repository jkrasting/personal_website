    doi: "10.1029/2019MS001726"
    significance: "Establishes the foundational ocean model for GFDL's CMIP6 contributions, demonstrating that hybrid depth-isopycnal coordinates reduce middepth warming drift and that mesoscale eddy parameterization is essential for maintaining water mass structure at half-degree resolution."
  - title: "Structure and performance of GFDL's CM4.0 climate model"
    authors: "Held, I., Guo, H., Adcroft, A., Dunne, J., Horowitz, L., *Krasting, J.*, Shevliakova, E., Winton, M., Zhao, M., Bushuk, M., Wittenberg, A., et al."
    journal: "Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems"
    year: 2019
    doi: "10.1029/2019MS001829"
    significance: "Documents GFDL's physical climate model achieving state-of-the-art simulation of ENSO, reduced double-ITCZ bias, and excellent Arctic sea ice representation, establishing the benchmark for NOAA's climate projection capability used in national assessments."

    authors: "Dunne, J. P., John, J. G., Adcroft, A. J., Griffies, S. M., Hallberg, R. W., Shevliakova, E., Stouffer, R. J., Cooke, W., Dunne, K. A., Harrison, M. J., *Krasting, J. P.*, et al."
    journal: "Journal of Climate"
    year: 2012
    doi: "10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00560.1"
    significance: "Introduces GFDL's first coupled carbon-climate models comparing pressure-layer and isopycnal ocean formulations, establishing that neither configuration is fundamentally superior and enabling systematic assessment of ocean model impacts on Earth system interactions."

Climate and Earth System Models are some of our most advanced tools for understanding climate dynamics and projecting future change. By integrating physical climate processes and biogeochemical cycles, their projections underpin global climate assessments such as those by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and National Climate Assessment (NCA) to inform future decisions surrounding mitigation, adaptation, and infrastructure planning. Improving these models—through better computational methods, physical parameterizations, and comprehensive validation—directly enhances confidence in future climate projections and supports informed decision-making.

I have been a core contributor to multiple generations of GFDL's climate models used in major international assessments, including ESM2, CM4, ESM4, CM4X, and I am currently co-leading the development of CM5 and OM5. My roles have centered on ocean physics and biogeochemistry implementation, model tuning and validation, developing diagnostic infrastructure, and coordinating development teams.
