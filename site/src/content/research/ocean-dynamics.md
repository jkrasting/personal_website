keyPublications:
  - title: "Uncovering the seasonality of storm-driven Southern Ocean heat and carbon uptake"
    authors: "Turner, K. E., *Krasting, J. P.*, Russell, J., Stouffer, R. J."
    journal: "Journal of Climate"
    year: 2025
    doi: "10.1175/JCLI-D-24-0642.1"
    significance: "Reveals that synoptic storms drive net anomalous heat and carbon release from the Southern Ocean with strong seasonality, demonstrating high uncertainty in storm impacts that could impose opposing shifts in future ocean uptake patterns."
  - title: "Revisiting interior water mass responses to surface forcing changes and the subsequent effects on overturning in the Southern Ocean"
    authors: "Tesdal, J., MacGilchrist, G. A., Beadling, R. L., Griffies, S. M., *Krasting, J. P.*, Durack, P. J."
    journal: "Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans"
    year: 2023
    doi: "10.1029/2022JC019105"
    significance: "Shows that Antarctic Bottom Water volume changes under ice sheet melt exceed surface-forced water mass transformation by 4-fold in high-resolution models, revealing that interior mixing processes amplify deep ocean responses in ways that vary dramatically between model configurations."
  - title: "Importance of the Antarctic Slope Current in the Southern Ocean response to ice sheet melt and wind stress change"
    authors: "Beadling, R., *Krasting, J.*, Griffies, S., Hurlin, W., Bronselaer, B., Russell, J., MacGilchrist, G., Tesdal, J., Winton, M."
    journal: "Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans"
    year: 2022
    doi: "10.1029/2021JC017608"
    significance: "Demonstrates that the Antarctic Slope Current controls whether meltwater triggers positive or negative feedback on ice sheet melting, with well-resolved currents trapping meltwater on the shelf and isolating West Antarctica from warm offshore waters."
  - title: "Role of ocean model formulation in climate response uncertainty"
    authors: "*Krasting, J. P.*, Stouffer, R. J., Griffies, S. M., Hallberg, R. W., Malyshev, S. L., Samuels, B. L., Sentman, L. T."
    journal: "Journal of Climate"
    year: 2018
    doi: "10.1175/JCLI-D-18-0035.1"
    significance: "Establishes that subgrid-scale ocean mixing representation dominates over vertical coordinate choice in determining equilibrium climate response, demonstrating that two differently-formulated ocean models can produce similar surface responses but divergent overturning and carbon uptake."

Ocean currents transport heat, carbon, and nutrients around the globe. These ocean dynamics play a pivotal role in shaping Earth's climate.   Understanding these fundamental processes—how they work today and how they'll change in a warming world—is essential for improving climate projections, predicting sea level changes, and assessing impacts on ecosystems and regional weather patterns. I use diagnostics and high-resolution climate model simulations to track heat, salt, and volume through key circulation pathways, revealing mechanistic links between surface forcing (like winds and heat fluxes) and interior ocean changes that affect climate variability and long-term change.

My research activities focus on both fundamental mechanisms and applied diagnostics. I have a particular focus on the role of the Southern Ocean, and I am actively involved with both the Southern Ocean Climate Carbon Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) project and the World Climate Research Programme's Southern Ocean Region Panel (SORP).  Postdoctoral researchers studying with me have explored watermass transformation budgets in finite-volume ocean models to quantify how surface processes create and modify water masses, and how meltwater from Antarctica influences the oceanic and atmospheric circulations.  These efforts continue to deepen our understanding of ocean dynamics while informing projections of future climate and sea level.
