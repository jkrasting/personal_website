Sea level rise is one of the most profound and immediate consequences of climate change, affecting coastal communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems globally. Simulating and predicting future sea levels is challenging due to uncertainties in how ice sheet dynamics, ocean heat uptake, and regional circulation changes are represented in climate models. It's vital to understand not only the extent of global sea level rise over the course of the next century, but also the near-term trends and regional patterns over the next few decades to aid in coastal adaptation planning. My work focuses on two primary areas: steric sea level change, which involves the expansion and contraction of seawater due to warming and freshening; and the short-term ocean dynamics that cause coastal water level variability on seasonal timescales. This research directly informs NOAA's coastal sea level guidance and supports communities in planning infrastructure investments worth billions of dollars.

I currently lead a $5.8 million Congressional Appropriation at NOAA-GFDL, funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to improve sea level prediction on seasonal-to-annual timescales using advanced models. This five-year initiative seeks to develop fundamental understanding, models, and methods for predicting coastal sea level fluctuations months to seasons in advance, which is essential for proactive management of coastal flooding risks. I continue to collaborate with NOAA's Physical Sciences Laboratory, the National Ocean Service, and academic partners to advance scientific understanding and operational capabilities for sea level prediction.
