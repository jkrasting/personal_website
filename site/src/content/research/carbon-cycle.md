## Overview

The carbon cycle governs how Earth's land and ocean absorb atmospheric CO2, determining the climate system's response to human emissions. Ocean carbon uptake moderates atmospheric CO2 concentrations but causes ocean acidification that threatens marine ecosystems. Land carbon sinks—forests, soils, vegetation—sequester carbon but may weaken under warming. Understanding these processes is essential for projecting future climate trajectories and informing emissions policy. A critical question for climate mitigation is: how does climate sensitivity depend on total emissions versus the rate at which we emit? Dr. Krasting's research addresses this question and related biogeochemistry dynamics through Earth system modeling, process diagnostics, and innovative applications of machine learning.

Dr. Krasting's carbon cycle research integrates biogeochemical modeling in GFDL Earth system models with process-oriented diagnostics and machine learning approaches. His work spans ocean carbon uptake mechanisms, regional acidification patterns, land-atmosphere carbon exchange, and the climate system's transient response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE). By combining traditional carbon budget analysis with machine learning attribution methods, his research identifies which processes control regional carbon cycle responses and how uncertainties propagate into climate projections. This integrated approach has yielded insights from the trajectory sensitivity of climate response to emission rates (*GRL*, 2014) to machine learning-revealed patterns of Arctic acidification (*Communications Earth & Environment*, 2022).

## Major Discoveries

Dr. Krasting's pioneering 2014 *Geophysical Research Letters* paper "Trajectory sensitivity of the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions" demonstrated that climate sensitivity depends not only on total cumulative emissions but also on the rate at which they accumulate. Using GFDL's Earth system model, the study showed that rapid emission scenarios produce greater warming per unit carbon than gradual scenarios—a finding that influences how scientists interpret emission pathway scenarios and climate targets. His 2022 *Communications Earth & Environment* paper applied neural networks to Arctic Ocean acidification, revealing regional sensitivity patterns invisible to traditional analysis methods. This work demonstrated that different Arctic regions respond to distinct drivers—atmospheric CO2, sea ice loss, or freshwater inputs—enabling targeted projections of ecosystem impacts. His contributions to GFDL model development include documenting ocean biogeochemistry in ESM4 (*JAMES*, 2020) and land carbon dynamics in LM4.1 (*JAMES*, 2024), advancing representation of carbon cycle processes in IPCC-class models.

## Current Work

Current work investigates climate sensitivity across multiple timescales through a collaborative effort examining the "utility of the transient climate response" (manuscript submitted to *GRL*). Dr. Krasting continues to contribute to carbon cycle model development in GFDL's CM5 and ESM5, improving representation of ocean biogeochemistry and land-atmosphere carbon exchange. His process diagnostics work includes developing carbon budget tools for the next generation of models and investigating how Southern Ocean storm activity affects carbon uptake seasonality. With the NOAA Model Diagnostics Task Force, he is building community frameworks for evaluating biogeochemical processes across climate models, enabling systematic improvement of carbon cycle projections.
