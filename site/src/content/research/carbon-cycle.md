  - title: "Regional sensitivity patterns of Arctic Ocean acidification revealed with machine learning"
    authors: "*Krasting, J. P.*, Palma, M. D., Sonnewald, M., Dunne, J. P., John, J. G."
    journal: "Communications Earth & Environment"
    year: 2022
    doi: "10.1038/s43247-022-00419-4"
    significance: "Applies unsupervised machine learning to identify four distinct Arctic acidification sub-regions governed by sea ice patterns, revealing that sea surface salinity and alkalinity reductions—not just CO2—dominate Arctic pH changes through ice-mediated freshening."

    journal: "Nature Communications"
    year: 2017
    doi: "10.1038/s41467-017-01038-w"
    significance: "Demonstrates that mid-latitude deforestation increases hot-dry summer occurrence from once-per-decade to every 2-3 years, establishing land cover change as a first-order driver of regional climate extremes beyond its carbon cycle effects."

    journal: "Geophysical Research Letters"
    year: 2014
    doi: "10.1002/2013GL059141"
    significance: "First demonstration that climate warming per unit carbon depends on emission rate, not just cumulative total—rapid emissions produce greater warming than gradual scenarios for the same carbon budget, challenging assumptions underlying climate targets."
    firstAuthor: true
  - title: "Historical warming reduced due to enhanced land carbon uptake"
    authors: "Shevliakova, E., Stouffer, R. J., Malyshev, S., *Krasting, J. P.*, Hurtt, G. C., Pacala, S. W."
    journal: "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences"
    year: 2013
    doi: "10.1073/pnas.1314047110"
    significance: "Quantifies that CO2 fertilization of the terrestrial biosphere has limited atmospheric CO2 rise to 115 ppm instead of 200 ppm since preindustrial times, reducing global warming by 0.31°C—a 40% climate benefit from land carbon uptake."

The land and ocean play an important role in determining the climate system's response to human emissions through the absorption and redistribution of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. Ocean carbon uptake helps slow atmospheric CO₂ rise but drives acidification that threatens marine ecosystems, while the long-term fate of terrestrial carbon sinks remains highly uncertain as the planet warms. Understanding these interactions and their sensitivity to the amount and the rate of carbon dioxide emissions, is crucial for reliable climate projections and for informing effective mitigation and policy decisions. My work uses Earth System Models to diagnose the complex drivers of carbon uptake, acidification patterns, and feedbacks that drive the climate warming response to emissions.

My research integrates biogeochemical modeling within GFDL Earth System Models. I examine mechanisms of ocean heat and carbon uptake, regional acidification responses, and land–atmosphere carbon exchanges, by applying carbon budget diagnostics and more advanced clustering analysis. My previous work demonstrates that climate warming per unit carbon depends on the emission rate, and that the rate of carbon emissions can be linked to the expression of basin-scale patterns of sea level rise. Current efforts include applying machine learning and cluster analysis to understand ocean acidification, elucidating the mechanisms behind subsurface marine heatwaves, and developing community diagnostic tools to evaluate biogeochemical processes across climate models.
