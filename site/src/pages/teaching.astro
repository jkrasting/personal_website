        <p>
          We are living in an era of rapid information transformation. Content is more readily available to students, and their attention is continuously being diverted and sought after on multiple platforms and in a variety of formats—from print to video to AI-generated content. In such an environment, my teaching philosophy emphasizes qualities that are uniquely human: <strong>curiosity and creativity</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a lecturer in the Department of Environmental Sciences at Rutgers University and in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program at Princeton University, I have come to understand that research and teaching are deeply intertwined. As we teach, we continuously build curiosity around the topic and grow a deeper understanding of the material. This process can generate creative and innovative ideas, as well as new solutions. To do this in the classroom, one must be an effective communicator. With a unique combination of skills, I can leverage my former experience as a broadcast meteorologist, which has enabled me to understand the value of messaging and the importance of engagement when conveying complex scientific content.
        </p>
        <p>
          To educate and teach others, I strive to strike a balance between critical thinking and fundamental theory, while fostering ongoing curiosity and creativity.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 pt-2">Learning Through Questioning</h3>
        <p>
          In the classroom, I take a Socratic approach in guiding students to arrive at their own conclusions. I view myself as a trail guide over the course of a semester, and my role is to lead students on a journey of exploration, encouraging them to notice, question, and explore along the way. I strongly encourage the students to seek out evidence to support their views and to reinforce what they are learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I facilitate in-class discussions where students can safely engage with each other, practice posing and answering questions, and learn from one another. With thought-provoking questions, I guide students to discover relationships between different elements and processes of the Earth system rather than memorizing isolated facts.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 pt-2">Inclusive and Adaptable Teaching</h3>
        <p>
          Each student is unique and approaches learning in an individual way. I believe in understanding the diverse learning styles of my students and tailoring my lessons and lectures to meet their individual needs. My lectures are often filled with analogies, allegories, personal anecdotes, and real-world examples that draw on my experiences communicating science to diverse audiences through outreach and extension activities, while also being rooted deeply in traditional theoretical, mathematical, and physical interpretations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recognize that students demonstrate understanding in different ways, and I design my lectures and assessments accordingly. I also believe in creating a safe environment where students feel comfortable sharing what they know, as well as what they do not know. I believe in being generous with my time and being accessible to all students outside of class for additional assistance or further discussions. I apply this philosophy to individual mentoring activities with graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, where I create environments that foster the practice and growth of their analytical and problem-solving skills on research projects that push the boundaries of their understanding.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 pt-2">Developing Essential Skills</h3>
        <p>
          Students must also develop professional skills in addition to a basic understanding of the subject. For example, in my graduate course at Princeton, I have incorporated Python coding exercises into my problem sets. I use these assignments as opportunities to provide feedback to my students on the importance of good coding practices and documentation, helping them grow both their technical abilities and scientific knowledge. I emphasize the importance of strong communication skills and effective presentations in the feedback I provide to students, whether they are presenting a weather discussion in my introductory undergraduate course at Rutgers or a final presentation in my graduate course. I strive to provide all my students and mentees with the tools and skills that will enable them to have flourishing careers and achieve a greater return on their investment in research and education.

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Strong mentoring requires balancing guidance with independence. I provide clear direction on research questions and methods while encouraging mentees to develop their own scientific voice. Regular meetings focus on both technical skills (programming, data analysis, model interpretation) and professional development (writing, presenting, networking). The measure of successful mentoring is not just publications produced, but scientists developed--researchers who can formulate questions, design investigations, and communicate findings independently.
