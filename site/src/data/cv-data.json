Content is more readily available to students, and their attention is continuously being diverted and sought after on multiple platforms and in a variety of formats. In such an environment, my teaching philosophy emphasizes qualities that are uniquely human: curiosity and creativity. As a lecturer at Rutgers University and Princeton University, I have come to understand that research and teaching are deeply intertwined. As we teach, we continuously build curiosity around the topic and grow a deeper understanding of the material.",
