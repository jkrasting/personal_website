## Introduction Section

### Opening Paragraph

Dr. Krasting's research addresses fundamental questions about Earth's changing climate through integrated studies of ocean dynamics, sea level rise, carbon cycling, and Earth system model development. His work spans the full lifecycle of climate science—from developing advanced computational models to diagnosing their physical processes, publishing discoveries in top-tier journals, and translating findings into tools that serve coastal communities and policymakers. With 44 peer-reviewed publications, $8.75 million in competitive research funding, and leadership roles in major modeling initiatives, his research program combines rigorous physical understanding with practical applications.

### Research Philosophy Paragraph

At the core of Dr. Krasting's approach is the conviction that reliable climate projections require both improved models and better methods for evaluating them. This philosophy drives his dual focus on Earth system model development—as a core contributor to GFDL's CM4, ESM4, CM5, and OM5 models used in IPCC assessments—and process-oriented diagnostics that reveal why models behave as they do. By understanding the physical mechanisms governing ocean circulation, heat transport, and carbon uptake, his research enables targeted model improvements that enhance projection reliability. This integrated approach has yielded insights ranging from regional sea level rise patterns to the climate system's response to carbon emissions, earning recognition including NOAA/OAR Employee of the Year and publication in *Nature* family journals.

## Research Area 1: Sea Level Rise & Coastal Impacts

### Icon
Waves or Water

### Short Description (for overview card)
Leading research on global and regional sea level projections, steric sea level changes, and coastal inundation using state-of-the-art Earth system models.

### Detailed Description (for expanded section)

Sea level rise poses one of the most immediate and costly impacts of climate change, yet projecting its magnitude and regional patterns remains challenging. Dr. Krasting's research addresses this challenge through investigations of steric sea level change—the expansion of seawater due to warming and freshening—and its drivers including ocean heat uptake, water mass transformation, and circulation changes. His landmark 2016 *Nature Geoscience* paper demonstrated that the Atlantic Ocean experiences significantly higher sea level rise than the Pacific under high carbon emissions, establishing that regional differences in ocean heat uptake produce spatially varying coastal impacts. This discovery transformed understanding of regional sea level patterns and informed NOAA's coastal adaptation strategies.

Currently, Dr. Krasting leads a $5.8 million Bipartisan Infrastructure Law project to improve seasonal sea level predictions, developing methods to forecast coastal flooding risks 6-12 months in advance. His recent work in the *Journal of Climate* (2024) investigated relationships between steric sea level rise, model drift, and water mass representation in GFDL's latest models, providing critical insights for next-generation projections. With three manuscripts on sea level currently in review and ongoing collaborations with NOAA's National Ocean Service, his research directly supports communities planning for coastal resilience.

## Research Area 2: Ocean Dynamics & Circulation

### Icon
Globe or CircularArrows

### Short Description (for overview card)
Expert in ocean circulation, water mass transformation, Antarctic Slope Current dynamics, and Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.

### Detailed Description (for expanded section)

Ocean circulation governs the planet's heat and carbon transport, making it central to climate dynamics and future change. Dr. Krasting's work in this area focuses on water mass transformation—the processes by which surface forcing creates and modifies ocean water masses—and their role in driving global circulation, heat uptake, and sea level patterns. He has made significant contributions to understanding the Antarctic Slope Current's importance in mediating ice sheet melt impacts on the Southern Ocean, the role of storm activity in driving ocean heat and carbon uptake, and the mechanistic links between North Atlantic circulation and US East Coast sea level variability.

His research employs advanced diagnostic frameworks to track heat, salt, and carbon through ocean circulation pathways, revealing the physical mechanisms that control climate system behavior. Recent work has investigated how Antarctic meltwater affects atmospheric circulation patterns (*Geophysical Research Letters*, 2024), how storms drive seasonal Southern Ocean carbon uptake (*Journal of Climate*, 2025), and how North Atlantic ocean heat content influences East Coast sea level (*JGR: Oceans*, 2024). As co-developer of water mass transformation budget frameworks for finite-volume ocean models (*JAMES*, 2025), he has created tools that enable the climate modeling community to diagnose fundamental ocean processes.

### Key Statistics

## Research Area 3: Carbon Cycle & Biogeochemistry

### Icon
Atom or Molecule

### Short Description (for overview card)
Research on ocean carbon uptake, acidification, and the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE).

### Detailed Description (for expanded section)

Understanding how the ocean and land absorb carbon dioxide is essential for predicting future climate trajectories and informing emissions policy. Dr. Krasting's biogeochemistry research spans ocean carbon uptake dynamics, regional acidification patterns, and the climate system's transient response to cumulative carbon emissions. His pioneering 2014 *Geophysical Research Letters* paper demonstrated that climate sensitivity depends not only on total emissions but also on the rate at which they occur—a finding that has influenced how scientists and policymakers think about emission pathways and climate targets.

His 2022 *Communications Earth & Environment* paper applied machine learning to Arctic Ocean acidification, revealing regional sensitivity patterns that traditional analysis methods had missed. By training neural networks on climate model output, the study identified how different Arctic regions respond to atmospheric CO₂, sea ice changes, and freshwater inputs—insights that inform projections of ecosystem impacts in a rapidly changing Arctic. Dr. Krasting has also contributed to major model development efforts documenting ocean biogeochemistry in GFDL's ESM4 (*JAMES*, 2020) and land carbon dynamics in LM4.1 (*JAMES*, 2024), advancing representation of carbon cycle processes in IPCC-class models.

### Key Statistics

## Research Area 5: Model Diagnostics & Evaluation

### Icon
ChartBar or Beaker

### Short Description (for overview card)
Co-Lead of NOAA Model Diagnostics Task Force, developing process-oriented diagnostics frameworks that evaluate specific physical processes.

### Detailed Description (for expanded section)

Climate models are complex systems whose fidelity depends not just on reproducing observed means, but on correctly representing the physical processes that govern climate. Dr. Krasting co-founded and co-leads NOAA's Model Diagnostics Task Force, which has pioneered the development and application of process-oriented diagnostics (PODs)—computational tools that evaluate specific mechanisms like convection, ocean mixing, or carbon cycling rather than aggregate statistics. This approach enables modelers to identify why their models behave as they do and where targeted improvements are needed.

Since 2018, Dr. Krasting has secured $4.7 million in competitive NOAA Climate Program Office funding to support this initiative, building a collaborative framework that spans NOAA laboratories, university partners, and international modeling centers. The Task Force has developed over 50 diagnostics covering atmospheric dynamics, ocean processes, land-atmosphere coupling, and biogeochemistry, all available as open-source software. This work earned Dr. Krasting NOAA/OAR Employee of the Year in 2021 for "outstanding leadership in developing diagnostic frameworks and fostering new research collaborations." His 2023 *Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society* paper laid out principles for process-oriented diagnostics, practice standards, and community development pathways, establishing guidelines now adopted by modeling centers worldwide.

### Key Statistics
- **Funding**: $4.7M as Co-PI across three NOAA MAPP grants (2018-2027)
- **Leadership**: Co-Lead, NOAA Model Diagnostics Task Force (2018-present)

## Integration & Connections Section

### Section Title
**Interconnected Research**

### Content

These five research areas are deeply interconnected, reflecting the integrated nature of the climate system. Sea level rise research relies on understanding ocean dynamics—how circulation transports heat and drives regional patterns. Ocean dynamics depends on accurate Earth system models that resolve critical processes. Model development requires diagnostic frameworks to evaluate process fidelity. Carbon cycle research informs climate sensitivity, which shapes sea level projections.

This integrated approach enables Dr. Krasting to address complex climate questions that span traditional disciplinary boundaries. For example, his work on Antarctic ice sheet melt impacts required understanding ice-ocean interactions (ocean dynamics), implementing meltwater forcing in models (model development), diagnosing circulation responses (diagnostics), and projecting regional sea level changes (sea level rise). Similarly, his Arctic acidification research combined biogeochemical modeling (carbon cycle), machine learning diagnostics (diagnostics), and ESM development (model development).

By maintaining expertise across these areas, Dr. Krasting's research program addresses the full scope of climate modeling challenges: developing better models, understanding their processes, and applying them to pressing societal questions about sea level rise and climate impacts.
