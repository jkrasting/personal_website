## Professional Biography

### Paragraph 1: Current Position & Expertise

Dr. John P. Krasting is a Physical Scientist (ZP-IV) at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey, where he has led climate research for over 15 years. His expertise spans sea level rise, ocean dynamics, carbon cycle biogeochemistry, Earth system model development, and process-oriented model diagnostics. Currently, Dr. Krasting directs a $5.8 million Bipartisan Infrastructure Law project to improve seasonal sea level predictions for coastal communities, while serving as Lecturer at Princeton University and Adjunct Lecturer at Rutgers University. With 44 peer-reviewed publications, an h-index of 31, and over $8.75 million in competitive research funding, he has established himself as a leading authority on regional sea level rise and ocean circulation dynamics.

### Paragraph 2: Research Journey

Dr. Krasting's path to climate science began at Rutgers University, where he earned his Bachelor of Science in Meteorology in 2003 and his Ph.D. in Atmospheric Science in 2008. During his doctoral work, he developed expertise in climate model analysis and future climate projections, investigating Northern Hemisphere snowfall changes under greenhouse warming. Upon joining NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in 2009, Dr. Krasting's research evolved from atmospheric processes to ocean-centric climate dynamics, recognizing the ocean's critical role in sea level rise, heat uptake, and carbon storage. This evolution culminated in his landmark 2016 *Nature Geoscience* paper demonstrating enhanced Atlantic sea level rise relative to the Pacific—a discovery that transformed understanding of regional sea level patterns and informed coastal adaptation planning. Over the past decade, his research has increasingly focused on developing advanced diagnostic frameworks to understand the physical processes governing ocean circulation, heat transport, and their impacts on future climate.

### Paragraph 3: Major Contributions & Recognition

Dr. Krasting's contributions span fundamental climate science, model development, and community infrastructure. As a core developer of GFDL's CM4, ESM4, CM5, and OM5 climate models—used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments—he has advanced the representation of ocean physics and biogeochemistry in global climate projections. His first-author publications include groundbreaking work on regional sea level rise (*Nature Geoscience*, 2016), climate sensitivity to emission rates (*Geophysical Research Letters*, 2014), steric sea level and water mass representation (*Journal of Climate*, 2024), and machine learning applications to Arctic acidification (*Communications Earth & Environment*, 2022). Beyond individual research, Dr. Krasting co-founded and co-leads NOAA's Model Diagnostics Task Force, developing process-oriented diagnostic tools that have become community standards for climate model evaluation. This leadership earned him NOAA/OAR Employee of the Year in 2021, along with multiple Department of Commerce medals recognizing his contributions to Earth system model development (Silver Medal, 2014) and wildfire impact assessment (Bronze Medals, 2023 and 2024).

### Paragraph 4: Teaching & Mentoring

Teaching and mentoring have been integral to Dr. Krasting's career since his graduate teaching assistantship days at Rutgers (2003-2007). As an Adjunct Lecturer at Rutgers University since 2015, he has taught Introduction to Meteorology to hundreds of undergraduate students, emphasizing hands-on climate model experiments and connecting theoretical concepts to real-world environmental challenges. In 2025, he expanded his teaching portfolio as Lecturer at Princeton University, co-developing and teaching graduate-level Climate Dynamics (AOS-562), where students work with state-of-the-art climate models to investigate fundamental climate processes. Dr. Krasting's mentoring extends beyond the classroom: he has served as primary advisor for three postdoctoral researchers (2020-2025), guiding projects on water mass transformation, Antarctic ice sheet impacts, and subsurface marine heatwaves that have yielded eight publications in high-impact journals. He has also mentored five undergraduate researchers through competitive programs including the NOAA Ernest F. Hollings Scholarship and Princeton's CIMES Summer Internship, with one mentee co-authoring a first-tier journal publication and another serving on whose honors thesis committee he served.

### Paragraph 5: Service, Impact & Future Vision

Dr. Krasting's commitment to advancing climate science extends through extensive professional service. As Co-Lead of NOAA's Model Diagnostics Task Force since 2018, he has built a collaborative framework involving 50+ climate scientists across government laboratories, universities, and international institutions, resulting in open-source diagnostic software used by modeling centers worldwide. He has conducted 47+ peer reviews for journals including the *Journal of Climate*, *Journal of Geophysical Research*, and *Climate Dynamics*, and has reviewed proposals for the National Science Foundation, NOAA Climate Program Office, and Canada's NSERC. Dr. Krasting has organized symposia and conference sessions at major scientific meetings including the American Geophysical Union and Ocean Sciences Meeting, fostering community dialogue on sea level science and model evaluation. His work contributes directly to societal needs: GFDL models he helps develop inform IPCC assessments that guide international climate policy; his sea level research supports NOAA's coastal adaptation programs; and his diagnostic tools enable the climate modeling community to improve projection reliability. Looking ahead, Dr. Krasting's research agenda focuses on improving decadal sea level predictions through better representation of ocean processes, understanding regional climate responses to Antarctic ice sheet changes, and developing machine learning approaches to accelerate model evaluation—work supported by ongoing funding through 2027 and five manuscripts currently in review or preparation.
