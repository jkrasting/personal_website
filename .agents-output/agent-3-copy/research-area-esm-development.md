## Overview Section

### Paragraph 1: Role of Climate Models in Science & Society

Earth system models represent humanity's most sophisticated tools for understanding and projecting climate change. These computational frameworks integrate physics of the atmosphere, ocean, land, sea ice, and cryosphere with biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and other elements. They enable scientists to investigate fundamental climate processes, test hypotheses about Earth system behavior, and project future climate under different emission scenarios. Model outputs inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments that guide international climate policy, support national security and infrastructure planning, and provide the scientific foundation for trillion-dollar decisions about climate adaptation and mitigation. Developing these models requires teams of scientists working over years to decades, advancing numerical methods, physical parameterizations, and computational infrastructure.

### Paragraph 2: Krasting's Model Development Contributions

Dr. Krasting has been a core contributor to four generations of GFDL climate models spanning 15 years of development: ESM2 (IPCC AR5), CM4 and ESM4 (IPCC AR6), and the upcoming CM5 and OM5 (future assessments). His contributions span ocean physics, biogeochemistry, model tuning and validation, diagnostic infrastructure, and data publication. As Co-Lead of the GFDL OM5 Development Team and co-lead of CM5 development, he now coordinates multi-institutional efforts involving dozens of scientists. His technical expertise includes implementing ocean parameterizations, developing validation frameworks, coordinating model experiments for CMIP participation, and ensuring models meet community standards. These leadership roles build on over a decade of development experience contributing to GFDL's position as one of the world's premier climate modeling centers.

### Paragraph 3: Model Development Achievements & Recognition

Dr. Krasting's model development work has produced infrastructure used globally. GFDL CM4 and ESM4, documented in major *JAMES* papers (2019, 2020), formed the basis for NOAA's contributions to CMIP6 and IPCC AR6. His work on these models included implementing ocean diagnostics, conducting sensitivity experiments, tuning model climate, and publishing approximately 80% of NOAA-GFDL data to CMIP archives—data downloaded thousands of times by researchers worldwide. Documentation papers for CM4 (*JAMES*, 2019), ESM4 (*JAMES*, 2020), and OM4 (*JAMES*, 2019) have been cited hundreds of times collectively, establishing these models as community standards. His model development contributions have earned two US Department of Commerce Bronze Medals (2023, 2024) and one Silver Medal (2014), recognizing impact on climate science infrastructure and applications to wildfire assessment.

### Paragraph 4: Current Development Leadership & Future Models

As Co-Lead of GFDL's OM5 Development Team, Dr. Krasting coordinates development of the next-generation ocean component for climate projections, implementing advanced water mass diagnostics, improved numerical methods, and enhanced resolution. He co-leads CM5 development, integrating OM5 with updated atmosphere, land, and sea ice components. Recent work documenting the CM4X model hierarchy (*JAMES*, 2025) establishes a framework for understanding model sensitivity to resolution and physics choices. His development priorities include improving representation of ocean processes critical for sea level projections, implementing process-oriented diagnostics as standard model output, and ensuring GFDL models participate effectively in CMIP7 (planned 2026+). With model development funding through core GFDL support and his diagnostics grants, Dr. Krasting continues advancing community climate modeling capabilities.
