# Teaching & Mentoring

## Teaching Philosophy

I believe that climate science is fundamentally a discipline best learned through direct engagement with the systems we study. My teaching philosophy centers on learning by doing—using hands-on climate modeling exercises to build physical intuition before introducing mathematical formalism. Too often, students encounter climate dynamics as a wall of equations disconnected from the real atmosphere and ocean. Instead, I guide students to explore climate models interactively, developing intuition about processes like ocean heat uptake or atmospheric circulation patterns through computational experiments. This approach makes abstract concepts concrete and prepares students to become independent researchers who can ask meaningful questions of complex Earth system models.

My courses emphasize connections between fundamental physical principles and pressing societal challenges. When teaching about ocean dynamics, we don't just derive equations—we examine how Antarctic ice sheet melt affects coastal sea level in New Jersey, or how changing ocean circulation patterns impact fisheries. I structure courses around progressively complex challenges: students start with idealized model configurations to build process understanding, then advance to realistic simulations where multiple interacting processes create emergent behavior. Assessment focuses on scientific reasoning rather than rote calculation; students write research proposals, critique published papers, and present model-based investigations to their peers. This mirrors the actual practice of climate science and builds communication skills essential for career success.

Over 14 years of teaching at Rutgers and Princeton, I've continuously refined my pedagogy based on student feedback and advances in climate modeling. Early courses relied heavily on lectures; now I use a flipped classroom model where students engage with climate model output before class and use class time for collaborative problem-solving. I've developed new curriculum modules on sea level dynamics and process-oriented model evaluation—topics that didn't exist in traditional climate dynamics courses but are crucial for the next generation of climate scientists. Looking forward, I plan to integrate my mentoring approach more formally into coursework, providing undergraduates with pathways to independent research projects. The students I've mentored—from summer interns to postdoctoral researchers—consistently become co-authors on published papers, demonstrating that hands-on training in research methods translates to genuine scholarly contributions.

## Mentoring

### Postdoctoral Researchers

Over the past five years, I have served as primary advisor or co-advisor for four postdoctoral researchers, collaborating on cutting-edge research in ocean dynamics, sea level rise, and climate modeling. My mentoring philosophy emphasizes developing independence while providing strong scientific guidance—I work closely with postdocs to refine research questions, interpret results, and craft compelling narratives for publication, while encouraging them to take ownership of their projects and develop their own collaborations.

Each student completes an independent research project, presents findings at national conferences, and co-authors publications when their contributions warrant authorship.

**Mentoring Philosophy:**
Strong mentoring requires balancing guidance with independence. I provide clear direction on research questions and methods while encouraging mentees to develop their own scientific voice. Regular meetings focus on both technical skills (programming, data analysis, model interpretation) and professional development (writing, presenting, networking). I actively connect mentees with collaborators, funding opportunities, and career resources. The measure of successful mentoring is not just publications produced, but scientists developed—researchers who can formulate questions, design investigations, and communicate findings independently.
