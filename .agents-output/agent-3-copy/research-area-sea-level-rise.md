## Overview Section

### Paragraph 1: Scientific Challenge & Societal Importance

Sea level rise poses one of the most pressing and costly impacts of climate change, threatening coastal communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems worldwide. Yet projecting future sea level remains challenging due to uncertainties in ice sheet dynamics, ocean heat uptake patterns, and regional circulation changes. Understanding not just how much global mean sea level will rise, but where and why regional patterns differ, is essential for coastal adaptation planning. Dr. Krasting's research addresses these challenges through investigations of steric sea level change—the expansion and contraction of seawater due to warming and freshening—and the ocean dynamics that create spatial variability in coastal impacts. His work directly informs NOAA's coastal sea level guidance and supports communities planning infrastructure investments worth billions of dollars.

### Paragraph 2: Research Approach & Methodology

Dr. Krasting's sea level research integrates Earth system modeling, ocean process diagnostics, and observational analysis to understand the mechanisms driving global and regional patterns. Using GFDL's high-resolution climate models (CM4, ESM4, OM5), he investigates how ocean heat uptake, water mass transformation, and circulation changes translate into regional sea level variability. His approach combines traditional sea level budget analysis with advanced diagnostics that track heat and salt through ocean circulation pathways, revealing why some ocean basins experience greater warming-driven expansion than others. Recent work has incorporated seasonal prediction frameworks, using ocean state initialization to forecast coastal sea level 6-12 months in advance—a capability critical for emergency preparedness and operational decision-making.

### Paragraph 3: Major Discoveries & Impact

Dr. Krasting's landmark 2016 *Nature Geoscience* paper "Enhanced Atlantic sea-level rise relative to the Pacific under high carbon emission rates" transformed understanding of regional sea level patterns. This first-author study demonstrated that under high emissions scenarios, the Atlantic Ocean experiences significantly greater steric sea level rise than the Pacific—up to 30% higher by 2100—due to differential ocean heat uptake controlled by circulation dynamics. This finding established that global mean projections mask critical regional differences, necessitating basin-specific adaptation strategies. The work has been cited over 100 times and directly influenced NOAA's regional sea level scenarios used in federal coastal planning. His 2024 *Journal of Climate* paper investigated relationships between steric sea level rise and model drift in GFDL's latest models, revealing how errors in water mass representation propagate into sea level biases—insights that inform next-generation model improvements.

### Paragraph 4: Current Work & Future Directions

Currently, Dr. Krasting leads a $5.8 million Bipartisan Infrastructure Law project (2022-2027) to "Assess and Improve Sea Level Prediction on Seasonal to Annual Timescales with Advanced Models." This five-year effort, for which he serves as Agency Project Lead at OAR/GFDL, develops methods to predict coastal sea level fluctuations months to seasons in advance, enabling proactive management of coastal flooding risks. The project integrates ocean observations, climate model forecasts, and machine learning to identify predictable signals in ocean heat content and circulation. With three manuscripts on sea level currently in review—including a major synthesis on sterodynamic contributions to regional projection uncertainty—and ongoing collaborations with NOAA's National Ocean Service and academic partners, Dr. Krasting's research program continues to advance both scientific understanding and operational capabilities for sea level prediction.
