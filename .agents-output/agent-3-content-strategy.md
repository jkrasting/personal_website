**Date**: January 2026
**Project**: Dr. John P. Krasting Academic Website
**Purpose**: Content creation guidelines for tenure review website

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the content strategy for Dr. Krasting's academic website, ensuring all copy serves the primary goal: **strengthening his case for tenure-on-hire at Rutgers University**. Every word, every data point, and every narrative choice should demonstrate research excellence, independent scholarship, teaching effectiveness, mentoring commitment, and service leadership.

---

## Primary Audience: Tenure Review Committee

**Who they are:**
- Senior faculty from Environmental Sciences and related departments
- Administrators evaluating tenure-on-hire case
- External reviewers assessing scholarly impact
- Busy professionals with limited time

**What they need:**
- Quick access to key qualifications
- Evidence of research impact (publications, citations, funding)
- Proof of independent scholarly trajectory
- Teaching effectiveness and commitment
- Mentoring track record
- Service to profession

**What they expect:**
- Professional, authoritative tone
- Evidence-based claims
- Clear, scannable content
- Comprehensive but concise information

---

## Tone of Voice Guidelines

### Professional Authority

**Do:**
- Use precise, scientific language
- State accomplishments confidently
- Reference concrete evidence (metrics, publications, awards)
- Maintain scholarly credibility
- Write in third-person for bio sections
- Use first-person sparingly (teaching philosophy only)

**Don't:**
- Use marketing hype or superlatives
- Make unsubstantiated claims
- Use jargon without explanation
- Be overly modest or self-deprecating
- Use casual or conversational language

**Examples:**

✅ **Good**: "Led development of GFDL's next-generation ocean model (OM5), incorporating advanced water mass transformation diagnostics."

❌ **Bad**: "I'm really passionate about ocean modeling and have done some cool work on OM5."

✅ **Good**: "Published groundbreaking research on regional sea level rise patterns in *Nature Geoscience* (IF 16.1)."

❌ **Bad**: "My amazing research on sea level rise was published in a top journal!"

---

### Clarity & Accessibility

**Do:**
- Write for educated non-specialists
- Explain technical terms on first use
- Use active voice
- Keep sentences concise (15-25 words avg)
- Break long paragraphs (3-5 sentences max)
- Use bullet points for lists

**Don't:**
- Assume deep climate science knowledge
- Use unexplained acronyms
- Write dense academic prose
- Create walls of text
- Bury key information in footnotes

**Examples:**

✅ **Good**: "Developed process-oriented diagnostics—computational tools that evaluate specific physical processes in climate models rather than aggregate statistics—enabling more targeted model improvements."

❌ **Bad**: "Developed PODs for ESMs to improve parametrization schemes via process-level evaluation frameworks."

---

### Evidence-Based Narrative

**Do:**
- Cite specific publications (by title or journal)
- Reference funding amounts and sources
- Quantify impact (citations, h-index, students mentored)
- Link claims to CV data
- Use present participles for ongoing work ("leading," "developing")
- Use past tense for completed work ("led," "developed")

**Don't:**
- Make vague claims ("significant impact")
- Omit specifics ("published widely")
- Exaggerate contributions
- Claim sole credit for collaborative work
- Use "currently" or "recently" without dates

**Examples:**

✅ **Good**: "Co-Lead of NOAA Model Diagnostics Task Force (2018-present), securing $4.7M in competitive funding across three NOAA Climate Program Office grants."

❌ **Bad**: "Currently involved in important diagnostic work with significant funding."

✅ **Good**: "Mentored 4 postdoctoral researchers (2020-2025), resulting in 8 publications in high-impact journals including *Geophysical Research Letters* and *Journal of Climate*."

❌ **Bad**: "Worked with several postdocs who published some papers."

---

### Forward-Looking & Dynamic

**Do:**
- Emphasize ongoing work
- Highlight future research directions
- Show trajectory of growth
- Connect past to future
- Demonstrate sustained productivity

**Don't:**
- Present as static or complete
- Focus only on past achievements
- Ignore works in progress
- Suggest research agenda is finished

**Examples:**

✅ **Good**: "Currently leading a $5.8M Bipartisan Infrastructure Law project (2022-2027) to improve seasonal sea level predictions, with 5 manuscripts in preparation and 2 in review."

❌ **Bad**: "Completed work on sea level predictions."

## Publication Annotation Approach

### Purpose

Each of the 44 publications needs a 1-2 sentence annotation that:
1. Summarizes the key finding or contribution
2. Highlights significance/impact (for featured papers)
3. Clarifies Krasting's specific role (for first-author papers)

### Annotation Types

#### Featured Publications (8 papers)

**Elements:**
- Key finding (1 sentence)
- Significance/impact (1 sentence)
- Methodology note (optional, for first-author)

**Example:**
```json
{
  "id": "pub-009",
  "annotation": "Demonstrated that the Atlantic Ocean will experience significantly higher sea level rise than the Pacific under high carbon emissions due to differential ocean heat uptake and circulation changes. This first-author study in *Nature Geoscience* (IF 16.1) established regional sea level rise as a critical factor in coastal planning."
}
```

#### First-Author Publications (4 papers)

**Elements:**
- Research question or goal
- Key finding
- Contribution percentage note

**Example:**
```json
{
  "id": "pub-037",
  "annotation": "Investigated the relationship between steric sea level rise, model drift, and water mass representation in GFDL's latest climate models. This first-author study (90% conceptualization, 85% writing) provides critical insights for improving sea level projections in next-generation models."
}
```

#### Standard Publications

**Elements:**
- Main contribution or finding (1 sentence)

**Example:**
```json
{
  "id": "pub-020",
  "annotation": "Comprehensive documentation of GFDL ESM 4.1, the Earth System Model used in IPCC AR6 assessments, detailing coupled model performance and simulation characteristics."
}
```

#### Mentored Papers

**Elements:**
- Finding + mentee note

**Example:**
```json
{
  "id": "pub-043",
  "annotation": "Revealed the seasonal patterns of storm-driven heat and carbon uptake in the Southern Ocean using GFDL climate models. Co-advised postdoc Dr. Katherine Turner as primary author (80% conceptualization)."
}
```

### Publication Annotation Guidelines

1. **Avoid jargon**: Explain technical terms
2. **Quantify when possible**: "30% reduction," "5-year forecast"
3. **Highlight methodology**: "machine learning," "high-resolution modeling"
4. **Connect to research areas**: Link to sea level, ocean dynamics, etc.
5. **Note collaborations**: Mention mentored students/postdocs
6. **Emphasize novelty**: "First to show," "new method," "comprehensive assessment"
